# Lecture Ground rules 
- Use the raise hand emoji (✋) if you have a question 
- Protect the Zoom chat! Keep chatter at a minimum so questions can come through.
- The moment you're confused, raise your hand. If you're confused, others might be, too. You're not alone, and they'll be grateful you asked. 
- "I don't know" is OK. Not participating is not. You learn more from being wrong. It's okay to be wrong, embrace it so that you can learn more.
- The more you participate, the more you learn!
